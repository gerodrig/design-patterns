/**
 * ! Bridge Pattern
 * This pattern allows us to decouple an abstraction from its implementation,
 * so that both can vary independently.
 *
 * * It is useful when there are multiple implementations of an abstraction
 * * It can be used to separate business logic from presentation logic
 * * It can also be used to separate user interface logic.
