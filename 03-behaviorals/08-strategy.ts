/**
 * ! Strategy Pattern
 *
 * The Strategy pattern is a software design pattern that defines a
 * family of algorithms, encapsulates them, and makes them interchangeable.
 *
 *
 * * It is useful when you have a class that has behavior that can
 * * change at runtime and you want to delegate the responsibility of
 * * the implementation to another class.

/**
 * !Objective: Explain the Strategy pattern using an example where several
 * ! ducks compete in a race and each one has its own
 * ! movement strategy (e.g., swimming, flying, or walking).
