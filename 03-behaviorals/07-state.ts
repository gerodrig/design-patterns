/**
 * ! State Pattern
 * This pattern allows an object to change its behavior
 * when its internal state changes.
 *
 * * It is useful when an object has behavior that depends on its state
 * * and must change its behavior at runtime depending on that state.

/**
 * * Objective: Implement the State pattern to simulate the operation
 * * of a vending machine.
 * * The machine has different states,
 *  * such as Waiting for Money,
 *  * Selecting Product,
 *  * Dispensing Product,
 * * and its behavior varies depending on the current state.
