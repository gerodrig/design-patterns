/**
 * ! Prototype Pattern:

 * It is a creational design pattern that allows us to copy existing objects without making
 * the code dependent on their classes.
 * 
 * * It is useful when we want to duplicate the content, 
 * * the title, and the author of a document, for example, or any complex object.
