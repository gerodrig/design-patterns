/**
 * ! Abstract Factory:
 * It is a design pattern that allows creating families of related objects
 * without specifying their concrete classes.
 *
 * Instead of creating individual objects directly,
 * we create factories that produce a set of related objects.
 *
 * * It is useful when you need to create objects that are part of a family
 * * and you want to ensure that these objects complement each other.

/**
 * The purpose of the Abstract Factory is to create families of related objects
 * (in this case, burgers and drinks) without specifying the concrete classes
 * of each of these objects in the main code.
