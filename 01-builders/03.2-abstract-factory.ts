/**
 * ! Abstract Factory:
 * It is a design pattern that allows creating families of related objects
 * without specifying their concrete classes.
 *
 * Instead of creating individual objects directly,
 * we create factories that produce a set of related objects.
 *
 * * It is useful when you need to create objects that are part of a family
 * * and you want to ensure that these objects complement each other.

/**
 * !Instructions:
  1. Complete the Product Classes:
  ‚Ä¢	ElectricCar should implement Vehicle and display the message "Assembling an electric car".
  ‚Ä¢	GasCar should implement Vehicle and display the message "Assembling a gas car".
  ‚Ä¢	ElectricEngine should implement Engine and display the message "Starting electric engine".
  ‚Ä¢	GasEngine should implement Engine and display the message "Starting gas engine".

  2. Complete the Factory Classes:
  ‚Ä¢	ElectricVehicleFactory should create an ElectricCar and an ElectricEngine.
  ‚Ä¢	GasVehicleFactory should create a GasCar and a GasEngine.

  3. Test the Code:
    ‚Ä¢	Run the code to ensure that each factory produces the correct type of vehicle and engine.
